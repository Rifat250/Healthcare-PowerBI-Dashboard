🏥 __Healthcare Provider Analytics Dashboard__

__Power BI | Healthcare Data Analytics__

#1️⃣ __Executive Summary__

__Business Problem__

Healthcare providers need visibility into how billing, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and patient services vary across departments, procedures, and locations. Without a centralized dashboard, decision-makers struggle to track financial performance and patient service patterns.

__Solution__

This Power BI dashboard brings together patient visits, diagnoses, procedures, insurance, and cost data into a single interactive report that allows users to analyze healthcare performance by city, department, diagnosis, and service type.

__Business Impact__
* $3.36M in total billing analyzed
* $2.63M in treatment costs
* $2.23M covered by insurance
* $1.13M paid out-of-pocket
This helps hospital management understand revenue drivers, cost structure, and patient service utilization.

#2️⃣ __Business Problem__

Hospitals manage thousands of patient visits across different medical departments and services. Each visit involves multiple financial components such as treatment cost, medication, insurance claims, and room charges. Without analytics, it is difficult to:
* Compare department-wise performance
* Understand which procedures generate the most revenue
* Track emergency vs inpatient vs outpatient usage
* Monitor patient financial burden
This dashboard was created to solve these challenges.

#3️⃣ __Methodology__

This project was built entirely in Power BI using a structured data model and DAX measures.

__Data Modeling__

A star-schema style model was created with Visits as the central table connected to:
* Patients
* Providers
* Cities
* Departments
* Diagnoses
* Procedures
* Insurance
* Date
This allows slicing and filtering healthcare performance across multiple dimensions.

__Analysis Approach__
* Built calculated measures for totals, averages, and percentages
* Designed KPIs to track revenue, costs, insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket payments
* Created interactive visuals for department, procedure, diagnosis, and geographic analysis

#4️⃣ __Skills Used__

__Power BI__
* Data modeling & relationships
* DAX measures (totals, averages, percentages)
* KPI cards
* Bar charts, maps, and matrix visuals
* Interactive filters and slicers

__Analytics__
* Revenue vs cost analysis
* Department and procedure comparison
* Service type (Emergency, Inpatient, Outpatient) analysis

#5️⃣ __Results & Insights__
* Total Billing: $3.36M
* Treatment Cost: $2.63M
* Insurance Coverage: $2.23M
* Out-of-Pocket: $1.13M
* Cardiology and Orthopedics generate the highest billing
* Pediatrics has the lowest billing volume
* X-Ray and CT Scan are the highest-revenue procedures
* Emergency visits contribute heavily to asthma, fracture, and hypertension cases

#6️⃣ __Business Recommendations__
* Focus investment on high-revenue departments like Cardiology and Orthopedics
* Monitor high-cost procedures (CT, MRI) to improve cost efficiency
* Strengthen insurance coverage for emergency-heavy diagnoses
* Use geographic insights to plan staffing and hospital capacity
