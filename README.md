🏥 Healthcare Provider Analytics Dashboard

Power BI | Healthcare Data Analytics

1.Executive Summary
Business Problem

Healthcare providers need visibility into how billing, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and patient services vary across departments, procedures, and locations. Without a centralized dashboard, decision-makers struggle to track financial performance and patient service patterns.

Solution

This Power BI dashboard brings together patient visits, diagnoses, procedures, insurance, and cost data into a single interactive report that allows users to analyze healthcare performance by city, department, diagnosis, and service type.

Business Impact

$3.36M in total billing analyzed

$2.63M in treatment costs

$2.23M covered by insurance

$1.13M paid out-of-pocket

This helps hospital management understand revenue drivers, cost structure, and patient service utilization.

2. Business Problem

Hospitals manage thousands of patient visits across different medical departments and services. Each visit involves multiple financial components such as treatment cost, medication, insurance claims, and room charges. Without analytics, it is difficult to:

Compare department-wise performance

Understand which procedures generate the most revenue

Track emergency vs inpatient vs outpatient usage

Monitor patient financial burden

This dashboard was created to solve these challenges.

3. Methodology

This project was built entirely in Power BI using a structured data model and DAX measures.

Data Modeling

A star-schema style model was created with Visits as the central table connected to:

Patients

Providers

Cities

Departments

Diagnoses

Procedures

Insurance

Date

This allows slicing and filtering healthcare performance across multiple dimensions.

Analysis Approach

Built calculated measures for totals, averages, and percentages

Designed KPIs to track revenue, costs, insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket payments

Created interactive visuals for department, procedure, diagnosis, and geographic analysis

4. Skills Used
Power BI

Data modeling & relationships

DAX measures (totals, averages, percentages)

KPI cards

Bar charts, maps, and matrix visuals

Interactive filters and slicers

Analytics

Revenue vs cost analysis

Department and procedure comparison

Service type (Emergency, Inpatient, Outpatient) analysis

5. Results & Insights

Total Billing: $3.36M

Treatment Cost: $2.63M

Insurance Coverage: $2.23M

Out-of-Pocket: $1.13M

Cardiology and Orthopedics generate the highest billing

Pediatrics has the lowest billing volume

X-Ray and CT Scan are the highest-revenue procedures

Emergency visits contribute heavily to asthma, fracture, and hypertension cases

6. Business Recommendations

Focus investment on high-revenue departments like Cardiology and Orthopedics

Monitor high-cost procedures (CT, MRI) to improve cost efficiency

Strengthen insurance coverage for emergency-heavy diagnoses

Use geographic insights to plan staffing and hospital capacity
